## Description


This CLI allows the you to **write** and store (algebraic) expressions under any chosen name. 

At any given time, you can **replace** the variables (letters (e.g., x)) in the expression with numbers (without modifying the stored algebraic expression) and **solve** them instantly.

The expressions can range from basic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division to the pythagorean theorem and quadratic formula.
